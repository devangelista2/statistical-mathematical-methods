    "In terms of statistics, Python is ranked as the number one programming language in 2023, and over 70% of machine learning professionals and data scientists rely on it for their work. Its simplicity, extensive libraries, and vibrant community make Python an ideal tool for solving complex problems in fields like Linear Algebra and Machine Learning, giving it a leading role in modern scientific computing.\n",
