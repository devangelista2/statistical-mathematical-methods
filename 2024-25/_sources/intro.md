# Statistical and Mathematical Methods for Machine Learning (SMM)
What follows are the teaching materials for the Statistical and Mathematical Methods for Machine Learning (SMM, in the following), Module 2, for the Academic Year 2024-2025, helded by professor Davide Evangelista.

## Topics
Module 2 of the SMM course is divided into 3 parts. In the first part (which will be covered in the first 2 to 3 lessons), we will briefly recall the basics of Python programming language, which will be our tool to test the algorithms. Moreover, we will introduce `numpy` (arguably the most used Python library for vetor and matrix manipulation), `matplotlib` (for visualization) and other add-on libraries for `numpy` such as `pandas` and `scipy`.

In the second part of the course, we will introduce the basics of Machine Learning, and in particular we will study how to implement some simple yet effective Machine Learning algorithms for Dimensionality Reduction and Classification. The focus will always be to deeply understand the math behind those concepts, and how their implementation relates to basic linear algebra concepts you studied during your bachelor degree.

In the last part, we will discuss Optimization techiniques such as Gradient Descent and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), for the solution of the *training problem* in Machine Learning algorithms. Moreover, we will introduce two frameworks (i.e. Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and Maximum A Posteriori (MAP)) commonly used in Machine Learning applications, with the aim of understanding the origin of some commonly-used formula you will see in the following courses, over the Master degree.

## Tutor of the Course
