By pre-processing the data as we did in class, you should obtain a matrix `X` containing the flattenened digits, with shape `(784, 42000)`, and a vector `Y` of the associated digit value, with a shape of `(42000,)`.\n",

    "2. The extension of this idea to the multiple classification task is trivial. Indeed, if we have more than 2 classes (say, $k$ different classes) $C_1, \\dots, C_k$, we just need to repeat the same procedure as before for each matrix $X_1, \\dots, X_k$ to obtain the distances $d_1, \\dots, d_k$. Then, the new digit $x$ from the test set will be classified as $C_i$ if $d_i$ is lower that $d_j$ for each $j = 1,...,k$. Repeat the exercise above with a 3-digit example. Comment the differences."
