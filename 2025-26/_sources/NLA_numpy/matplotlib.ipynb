    "# Visualization with Matplotlib\n",
    "Visualization in Python can be performed by a famous library named `matplotlib`, in particular its sub-package `matplotlib.pyplot`. Documentation can be found at [matplotlib.org](https://matplotlib.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Plotting in matplotlib is very easy. Given two $N$-dimensional vectors $x = (x_1, \\dots, x_N)$ and $y = (y_1, \\dots, y_N)$, containing the $N$ datapoints we want to represent, the function `plot(x, y)` will plot on the plane each couple $(x_i, y_i)$ for $i = 1, \\dots, N$, and will connect (by default) them with a line. Such a plot can be visualized by calling the function `show()`."

After that, it is possible to open a subplot with the command `plt.subplot(nrow, ncol, idx)`, where `nrow` and `ncol` represents the number of images per rows and the number of images per columns in our matrix of plots, while `idx` is an incremental value, starting from 1, that indicate where the plot we are going to do should be placed inside of the matrix. `idx=1` represents the upper-left corner and, while increasing, it moves the image from left to right and from up to down into the matrix. \n",
