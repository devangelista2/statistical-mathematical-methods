    "# Gradient Descent\n",
    "Consider a general *continuous* function $f: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}$. Given a set of *admissible solutions* $\\Omega \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^n$, an optimization problem is a problem of the form\n",
    "\n",

    "\\min_{x \\in \\Omega} f(x)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If $\\Omega = \\mathbb{R}^n$, we say that the optimization is **unconstrained**. If $\\Omega \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$, the problem is **constrained**. We will always assume $\\Omega = \\mathbb{R}^n$, i.e. the unconstrained setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Convexity\n",
    "A common assumption in optimization is the _convexity_. By definition, a function $f: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is convex if \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(tx_1 + (1-t)x_2) \\leq tf(x_1) + (1-t)f(x_2) \\qquad \\forall x_1, x_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}^n, \\quad \\forall t \\in [0, 1]\n",

    "![](./fig/convexity.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The importance of convex functions in optimization is that if $f(x)$ is convex, than every minimum point $x^*$ of $f(x)$ is a _global minimum_ and the set of global minima is connected (the $n$-dimensional extension of the concept of _interval_). On the other side, if a function is non-convex (_NOTE:_ the opposite of convex is **not** concave), then there can be multiple distinct minimum points, some of which are _local minimum_ while others are _global minimum_. Since in ML applications we want to find global minima, and discriminating between local and global minima of a function is an NP-hard problem, having convexity is a good thing. \n",

    "![](./fig/non_convexity.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## First-order conditions\n",
    "Most of the algorithms to find the minimum points of a given function $f(x)$ are based on the following property:\n",
    "\n",
    "**First-order sufficient condition:** If $f: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a continuously differentiable function and $x^* \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ is a minimum point of $f(x)$, then $\\nabla f(x^*) = 0$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, it holds:\n",
    "\n",
    "**First-order necessary condition:** If $f: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a continuously differentiable function and $\\nabla f( x^* ) = 0$ for $x^* \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, then $x^*$ is either a (local) minimum, a (local) maximum or a saddle point of $f(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, we want to find a point $x^* \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ such that $\\nabla f(x^*) = 0$. Those points are called **stationary points** of $f(x)$.\n",

    "## Gradient descent (GD)\n",
    "The most common algorithm to solve optimization problems is the so-called Gradient Descent (GD). It is an iterative algorithm, i.e. an algorithm that iteratively updates the estimate of the solution, converging to the correct solution after infinite steps, such that, at each iteration, the successive estimate is computed by moving in the direction of maximum decreasing of $f(x)$: $- \\nabla f(x)$. Specifically, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x_{k+1} = x_k - \\alpha_k \\nabla f(x_k) \\qquad k = 0, 1, \\dots\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the initial iterate, $x_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, is given as input and the **step-size** (equivalently, **learning rate**) $\\alpha_k > 0$ controls the decay rapidity of $f(x)$ for any $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choice the initial iterate\n",
    "The Gradient Descent (GD) algorithm, always require the user to input an initial iterate $x_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$. Theoretically, since GD has a _global convergence_ proprerty, for any $x_0$ it will always converge to a **stationary point** of $f(x)$, i.e. to a point such that $\\nabla f(x) = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $f(x)$ is convex, then every stationary point is a (global) minimum of $f(x)$, implying that the choice of $x_0$ is not really important, and we can always use $x_0 = 0$. On the other side, when $f(x)$ is not convex, we have to choose $x_0$ such that it is as close as possible to the _right_ stationary point, to increase the chances of getting to that. If an estimate of the correct minimum point is not available, we will just consider $x_0 = 0$ to get to a general local minima.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step Size\n",
    "Choosing the step size is the hardest component of gradient descent algorithm. Indeed, if $\\alpha_k$ is too small, there is a chance we never get to the minimum, getting closer and closer without reaching it. Moreover, we can easily get stuck on local minima when the _objective function_ is non convex. On the contrary, if $\\alpha_k$ is too large, there is a chance we get stuck, bouncing back and forth around the minima.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./fig/right_alpha.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Backtracking\n",
    "Choosing the right step-size at each iteration is non-trivial. Indeed, convergence of Gradient Descent methods is only guaranteed if the step-size $\\alpha_k$ satisfies, for any $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$, some conditions known as _Wolfe Conditions_:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Sufficient decrease:* $ f(x_k - \\alpha_k \\nabla f(x_k)) \\leq f(x_k) - c_1 \\alpha_k \\| \\nabla f(x_k) \\|_2^2 $;\n",
    "- *Curvature condition:* $\\nabla f(x_k)^T \\nabla f(x_k - \\alpha_k \\nabla f(x_k)) \\leq c_2 \\|  \\nabla f(x_k)  \\|_2^2$;\n",
    "\n",
    "with $0 < c_1 < c_2 < 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, those conditions are automatically satisfied if $\\alpha_k$ is chosen by the **backtracking algorithm**. The idea of this algorithm is to start from an initial guess for $\\alpha_k$, and then reducing it as $\\alpha_k \\leftarrow \\tau \\alpha_k$ with $\\tau < 1$ until the sufficient decrease condition is satisfied. A Python implementation for the backtracking algorithm can be found in the following."

    "### Stopping Criteria\n",
    "The gradient descent is an iterative algorithm, meaning that it iteratively generates new estimates of the minima, starting from $x_0$. Theoretically, after infinite iterations, we converge to the solution of the optimization problem but, since we cannot run infinite iterations, we have to find a way to tell the algorithm when its time to stop. A convergence condition for an iterative algorithm is called **stopping criteria**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that gradient descent aim to find stationary point. Consequently, it would make sense to use the norm of the gradient as a stopping criteria. In particular, it is common to check if the norm of the gradient on the actual iterate is below a certain tollerance and, if so, we stop the iterations. In particular\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stopping criteria 1:** Given a tollerance `tol_f`, for any iterate $x_k$, check whether or not $|| \\nabla f(x_k) || < tol_f || \\nabla f(x_0) ||$. If so, stop the iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, this condition alone is not sufficient. Indeed, if the function $f(x)$ is almost flat around its minimum, then $|| \\nabla f(x_k) ||$ will be small even if $x_k$ will be far from the true minimum. \n",
