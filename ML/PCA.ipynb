    "## Dimensionality Reduction\n",
    "While working with data, it is common to have access to very high-dimensional unstructured informations (e.g. images, sounds, ...). To work with them, it is necessary to find a way to project them into a low-dimensional space where data which is semantically similar is close. This approach is called **dimensionality reduction**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, assume our data can be stored in an $d \\times N$ array,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    X = [ x^1 x^2 \\dots x^N ] \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times N}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where each datapoint $x^j \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$. The idea of dimensionality reduction techniques in ML is to find a projector operator $P: \\mathbb{R}^d \\to \\mathbb{R}^k$, with $k \\ll d$, such that in the projected space $P(x)$, images semantically similar are close together. If the points in a projected space forms isolated popoulations such that _inside_ of each popoulation the points are close, while the distance _between_ popoulations is large, we call them **clusters**. A clusering algorithm is an algorithm which is able to find clusters from high-dimensional data."

    "## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)\n",
    "Principal Componenti Analyisis (PCA) is probabily the simplest yet effective technique to perform dimensionality reduction and clustering. It is an unsupervised algorithm, thus it does not require any label.\n",

Since the singular values represents the _quantity of informations_ contained in the corresponding singular vectors, keeping the first $k$ singular values and vectors can be the solution to our projection problem.
